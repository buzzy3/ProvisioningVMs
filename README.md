# ProvisioningVMs
Bash scripts to (ideally) provision a VM for "automated-ish" deployment

# Usage
1. Find the provisioning file you desire (their each pretty descriptive with version numbers and Linux kernels).
2. Use a wget command in your terminal window similar to this one: 
`wget -O Graylog2-OneNode-Ubuntu1604.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tscibilia/ProvisioningVMs/master/Graylog2-OneNode-Ubuntu1604.sh`
